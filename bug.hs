This Haskell code attempts to use a polymorphic function `apply` with a type signature that's too restrictive, preventing it from working correctly with different numeric types:

```haskell
apply :: Num a => a -> a -> a
apply x y = x + y 

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print (apply 5 10) -- Works fine
  print (apply 5.2 10.5) -- Type error!
```

The issue is that `Num a` only guarantees that `a` supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc., but doesn't automatically imply it can handle all possible types, like mixing `Int` and `Double`.
